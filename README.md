# Small High efficiency PCB Motor
## The project
The goal of this project is to create a small and highly efficient and very cheap to manufacture PCB Motor. The "comb" design allows for greater efficiency and torque density.

* **USB-C Powered:** Powered through a standard USB-C connection, making it incredibly user-friendly and compatible with modern power sources.
* **Cost-Effective Manufacturing:** Designed with simplicity and scalability in mind, it is extremely affordable to produceâ€”perfect for hobbyists and large-scale applications alike.
* **Efficient:** The comb-shaped stator maximizes efficiency by eliminating torque loss, ensuring optimal performance even under demanding conditions.
* **Seamless Integration:** Fully customizable, the motor can be easily modified or directly integrated into any project requiring a compact, inexpensive motor solution.
* **Advanced Control Capabilities:** Built-in position, velocity, and torque control offer a level of precision and flexibility typically reserved for far more expensive systems.
